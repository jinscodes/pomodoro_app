This is the onboarding screen and timer setting screen.

You can briefly check what kind of app this POMODORO is through onboarding section. Or, you can skip it using skip button on the appbar.

And then, you can set the timer whatever you want!

### Work time and Break time

POMODORO's main content is divided into work time and break time.

You can set each time in the setting screen.

- SESSIONS: work or study time
- SHORT BREAK: Break time between sessions to long break
- LONG BREAK: Break time after the round is done
- DAILY GOAL: Today's Targets You Want to Meet
- SESSIONS TO LONG BREAK: How long are you going to do shortbreak
